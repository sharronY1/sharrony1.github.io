  Benchmark Implementation: Curated and structured 270 VR game tasks from four top-rated VR games,
establishing the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs performance in immersive VR environments.
  Experiment: Benchmarked 7 cutting-edge LLMs on VR tasks, assessing their effectiveness in completing complex game objectives.
  Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth data analysis, assisting to the development of 3 scoring systems for
robust LLMs performance evaluation in VR settings.
  Survey: Designed and distributed questionnaires using Qualtrics to gather human evaluations of VR tasks, comparing them to AI model results.
