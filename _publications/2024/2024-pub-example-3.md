  <ul>
    <li><strong>Benchmark Implementation:</strong> Curated and structured 270 VR game tasks from four top-rated VR games, establishing the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs performance in immersive VR environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Benchmarked 7 cutting-edge LLMs on VR tasks, assessing their effectiveness in completing complex game objectives.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Conducted in-depth data analysis, assisting in the development of 3 scoring systems for robust LLMs performance evaluation in VR settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Survey:</strong> Designed and distributed questionnaires using Qualtrics to gather human evaluations of VR tasks, comparing them to AI model results.</li>
  </ul>
