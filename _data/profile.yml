    I am <strong> YAN Jiayi </strong>, a junior student from <strong> <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html" > The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) </a> </strong>, majoring in computer science. 
    I am about to participate in a one-semester exchange program at <strong> <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne(EPFL)  </a> </strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research primarily focuses on <strong> embodied AI agents and multimodal AI applications in VR software testing</strong>. I don't want to rush into deciding my field of specialization before exploring more areas. Right now, I am still exploring different fields and expanding my knowledge.
